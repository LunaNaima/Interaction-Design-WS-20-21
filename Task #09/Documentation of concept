<h1>Tangible Computing: Concept</h1><br>
<p>Setting up the ESP took a bit of time, but it worked out in the end. After setup, I tried several different materials and their effects,
such as a copper bell, a graphite pen, aluminium clippers, a power socket with three outputs and a measuring tape.
I discovered a resistance (measured in numeral drops in the 115200 Band) in all of the materials. I also tested a small circuit,
as seen on the video, with a graphite pen and multiple touch areas.The first thing that came to mind was a kind of touch game,
such as a Twister for fingers. An idea was to create a quiz, such as shown here.<br>
